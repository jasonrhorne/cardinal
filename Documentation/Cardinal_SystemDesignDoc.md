### Travel Itinerary App: System Design Overview

This document outlines the system architecture for a travel itinerary application designed for high-performance, scalability, and maintainability. The system leverages the Jamstack approach on Netlify, with an agentic backend powered by serverless functions and a modern, interactive frontend.

### 1. Architecture: Hybrid Jamstack

The application employs a hybrid Jamstack architecture, combining the speed of a pre-rendered static site with the dynamic capabilities of a serverless backend.

* **Frontend (Static):** The public-facing marketing pages and the core application shell are pre-built into static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) at build time. These files are served from Netlify's global CDN, ensuring instant load times.
* **Backend (Dynamic):** All core logic, including the multi-agent orchestration and API calls, is handled by Netlify Functions. These serverless functions are invoked on-demand by the frontend, eliminating the need for a persistent server.

### 2. Frontend Technology Stack

The frontend is built for a rich, interactive user experience with a focus on fast iteration.

* **Framework:** **Next.js** (React)
    * **Reasoning:** Provides a robust framework for building dynamic, data-driven applications. It supports hybrid rendering (SSG and SSR) to optimize performance where needed.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**
    * **Reasoning:** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development and prototyping without writing custom CSS. It's ideal for quickly building complex, responsive UIs like the chat interface and itinerary display.
* **Real-time Communication:** Native **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** via `EventSource` API or a lightweight wrapper library.
    * **Reasoning:** For the chat interface, the frontend will consume the streaming response from the backend function. This provides a real-time, ChatGPT-like experience where the user sees the itinerary "typing" as it's generated.

### 3. Backend Technology Stack

The backend is a decoupled, serverless microservice architecture designed for a complex agentic workflow.

* **Platform:** **Netlify Functions** (Edge and Background)
    * **Reasoning:** Provides a scalable, cost-effective serverless environment. It natively handles authentication, routing, and deployment.
* **Main Function (Concierge Agent):** **Netlify Edge Function**
    * **Reasoning:** Edge Functions are preferred for the main orchestration agent due to their higher execution time limits and support for response streaming, which is critical for the real-time user experience. This function acts as the central hub for the user request.
* **Specialized Functions (Research/Support Agents):** **Netlify Functions** (Standard or Background)
    * **Reasoning:** The main concierge function invokes other smaller, single-purpose functions to handle specific tasks (e.g., researching lodging, food, or validating a response). This modularity simplifies development and maintenance. For long-running, non-time-sensitive tasks, these could be implemented as **Netlify Background Functions** to bypass the standard 10-second timeout.
* **Agent Orchestration Layer:** **LangChain**
    * **Reasoning:** Instead of building the entire agentic logic from scratch, these frameworks provide a powerful abstraction layer. They handle the complex inter-agent communication, tool management, and workflow execution. This reduces development time and code complexity. The Netlify function would serve as a lightweight container that runs the logic defined by the orchestration framework.

### 4. Data and External Services

The application will be a "thin" backend, relying on external services for data and AI models.

* **AI Model:** Claude API (various models)
    * **Reasoning:** The core intelligence of the application is a large language model. All functions will interact with the LLM API to generate the itinerary and perform research.
* **Authentication & User Data:** A service like **Auth0**, **Clerk**, or **Supabase Auth**.
    * **Reasoning:** A dedicated authentication service offloads the complexity of user management, including sign-up, login, and secure session handling.
* **Database:** A serverless database like **Supabase**, **Neon (PostgreSQL)**, or a simple key-value store like **Upstash (Redis)**.
    * **Reasoning:** Used to store persistent user data, such as saved itineraries, past chat history, and user preferences. A serverless database is ideal as it scales with function usage and is cost-effective.

### 5. Deployment Workflow

The entire system is managed via a Git-based workflow on Netlify.

* **Version Control:** **GitHub**
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):** A push to the main branch automatically triggers a new build and deployment on Netlify.
* **Build Process:** Netlify builds the Next.js app, compiles the serverless functions, and deploys the entire application to its global CDN.
